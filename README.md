[![Build Status](https://github.com/phoenixsite/django-latch2/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/phoenixsite/django-latch2/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This is an application that integrates [Latch](https://latch.tu.com/en)
in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) sites.

IMPORTANT: this project is currently under development. Also, it strongly
relies on [latch-sdk-python](https://github.com/Telefonica/latch-sdk-python), which is also currently under development and without
a stable release. Its only usable branch is chore/modernize-repo. Until
both projects are released, I don't recommend using any of them in a
production environment.
