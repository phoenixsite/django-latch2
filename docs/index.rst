django-latch2 |release|
=======================

.. important:: **django-latch2 is still under development**

    Though it may seem already suitable for deployment environments, it
    relies on the `latch_sdk_python <https://github.com/Telefonica/latch-sdk-python>`_,
    which doesn't have still a stable version.
